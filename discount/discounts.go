	If the customer made purchase which is more than given amount in a month

	How it works? When a customer makes a purchase that has a total price more than given amount,
	we set it's consecutive discount to today() + 30 days, so when we're discounting the next purchase,
	we check if the consecutive discount date is greater than today(). If it is, we discount the purchase.
